# Machine learning project

This is the Machine learning assignment that is mandatory for the Machine Learning course at the VUB. The course was taken during 2022-2023.

Inside you'll find the provided example notebooks as well as the datasets (both outdated and updated)

For the project content please consult Project notebook.ipynb

This project has been made in Visual Studio Code with Python version 3.10.2

The used libraries as well as their versions can be found in requirements.txt
To install the libraries and their dependencies, type the following in the terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt

For the project I made use of a virtual environment.

To make a virtual environment in Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:

1. Open the the terminal in Visual Studio Code
2. Type in the terminal: python -m venv env to create a virtual environment
3. Type in the terminal: .\env\Scripts\activate to activate the virtual environment
4. Type in the terminal: pip install -r requirements.txt to install the libraries and their dependencies.
